Q: The AD group cannot be found but that's the name in AD!
A: Search for the group in AD and double-click on it and make sure the "Group name" is the same
   The group name is what we want but sometimes it's different to the display name

Q: The AD group cannot be found, but I've copied the group name correctly.
A: If the group has more than 5000 members, it will successfully fail in order to protect the shell from overloading

Q: It still says the group wasn't found...
A: Perhaps there is a bug in the code (oopsies)

Q: Where is my CSV?
A: It's in the Exported Member Lists folder in this directory; it has the group name and today's date in its name

Q: When I open the CSV, it's all on one line. Help. (Or any other weird looking format)
A: Copy it to your local machine and open it in Excel (Voila!)

Q: I want to get member information that is not in the CSV.
A: Let me know, I'll whip up something for you.

Q: I need multiple groups members lists in one CSV.
A: Do not fret, I can do this for you, let me know.
