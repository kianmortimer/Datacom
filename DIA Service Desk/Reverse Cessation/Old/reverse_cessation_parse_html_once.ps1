Description: 
- Script to parse HTML content into AD groups during the reverse cessation process

How-to:
- During the reverse cessation process, we manually add each group back to the account
- by going to the MSP job and painstakingly going through each AD group and either 
- writing them out again, or copying individually from the HTML Inspect Element view.
- This script simplifies the process by allowing you to copy one HTML element from 
- the Inspect Element view and paste it into this script, instantly copying the 
- relevant AD group names to the clipboard.

Workflow:
- Go to MSP disable user job > Logs
- Find the "Current user AD groups" log and click "View Details"
- Right-click on the grey box with all the text > Inspect Element
- Right-click on the highlighted HTML element > Copy Element
- Run this script (The parsed data will be copied to the clipboard automatically)
- Go to user in AD and add groups > Paste content and check names
- Profit

Help:
- Google the functions or ask me what's up
