Kian's Stuff

What:
 - Scripts written in PowerShell to support the DIA Service Desk
 - The scripts here automate/simplify some manual processes done by the Service Desk
 - Each script can be run by right-clicking and selecting "Run with PowerShell"
 - There is a help.txt file in each folder, and instructions in the code itself

Generic Warning:
 - PowerShell scripts have direct access to modify important systems
 - Use discretion when editing or creating any scripts, so you don't accidentally 
   delete all users from Active Directory or corrupt Jumphost (Screaming with fear)
 - Do not run any scripts that you do not trust or know what they do

More:
 - Want something made? Hit me up ;)
 - Now go out there and slay queen 🌟

General PowerShell Tips:
 - You can't run a script by double-clicking, you must right-click and "Run with PowerShell"
   (This is an inbuilt safety feature, but there is a workaround by creating a shortcut)
 - Right-click is both copy and paste in a PowerShell window - the normal Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V won't work
 - If a script freezes or hangs for too long you can safely terminate it any way you wish, or using the 
   KeyboardInterrupt shortcut: Ctrl+C
