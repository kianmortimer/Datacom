Q: What is reverse_cessation_parse_html.ps1 ?
A: Basically, if you were to go to an MSP cessation and try to add all the AD groups back to the 
   user's account, you only need to do one action to copy all the groups, instead of copying them all individually.
   - Refer to the guide on how to do this: reverse_cessation_parse_html - Guide.pdf

Q: Why is Active Directory frozen? When I have the PowerShell window open, I can't use AD...
A: Yeah, I have noticed this and googling it didn't tell me anything.
   I suspect it's because the PowerShell window is loading AD, the other instances of AD pauses.
   To get around this, just close the PowerShell window to then use AD.
