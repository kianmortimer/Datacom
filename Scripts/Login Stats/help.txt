Q: I don't know which script I need to run.
A: So you'll probably want to use the default "loginstats". 
   You can copy this to your Desktop or wherever else you want it.

Q: How do I use this?
A: Copy a user's username from AD and then run the script; the correct device name will be copied to your clipboard.

Q: I want to find out which user used a device last, not the device that a user used last.
A: Fear not, just copy the device name and run the loginstats script. 
   It won't copy the user to the clipboard, but you will be able to see it in the output and copy it from there.

Q: What's the point of using this instead of just searching loginstats.txt the normal way?
A: There isn't a need for this, but it is simpler and quicker to use.

Q: I ran loginstats_once and the window appeared and then disappeared and didn't do anything.
A: loginstats_once will take whatever is copied in the clipboard as the username, copy the 
   device name to the clipboard, and then close the window, without displaying anything.
   If you want a display, use the loginstats script.

Q: What does the loginstats_history script do?
A: If you search by user, it will get the last 5 logins and the devices that the user logged into.
   If you search by device, it will get the last 5 logins and the users that logged into the device.

Q: How many acres are in a hectare?

Q: I am not very intelligent and need more help. Please?
A: This stuff is confusing, don't worry (Handshake).
